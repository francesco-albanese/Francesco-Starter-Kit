# Francesco-Starter-Kit
This is my personal starter kit, which contains the basic file structure and folder scaffolding to quickly start a new project. Took inspiration from http://devtipsstarterkit.com/

## Getting Started

If you want to use it just git clone the repo and enjoy!

Both gulp and grunt config files are assuming a folder structure like the following:

  ```
  | -- app/
  |   | -- jade/
  |   | -- scss/
  |       | -- main.scss
  |   | -- js/
  |       | -- app.js
  |   | -- images/
  ```

### Technologies used

- [pug|jade](https://pugjs.org/api/getting-started.html)
- [sass](http://sass-lang.com/)
- [postcss](https://github.com/postcss/postcss)
- [jshint](https://github.com/jshint/jshint)
